# ExpMechFPCA
This code provides functions to help others recreate some of the work in the paper ["Benefits and Pitfalls of the Exponential Mechanism
with Applications to Hilbert Spaces and Functional PCA"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10864), to appear in ICML 2019.

This work is maintained by Ana Maria Kenney at Penn State, all questions about the code or algorithms should be sent to her (akenney375@gmail.com).  

### Files
The main codes are:
 * Simulations.R - Script for simulating functional data, applying the exponential mechanism for FPCA, and calculating performance measurements
 * Applications.R - Script for applying the exponential mechanism for FPCA on Berkeley growth and DTI data sets
